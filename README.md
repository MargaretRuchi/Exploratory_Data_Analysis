Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and relationships among passenger features and their survival outcomes. It includes data cleaning, visualization, feature relationships, and key statistical insights.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset
The dataset used is the train.csv file from the Titanic competition on Kaggle.

ðŸ“Š Key Steps
Data Cleaning

Filled missing values in Age with median and Embarked with mode

Checked for duplicates and dropped them (if any)

Univariate Analysis

Survival count

Class distribution

Age and Fare distributions

Bivariate Analysis

Survival by Sex

Age distribution vs Survival

Fare vs Passenger Class

Correlation heatmap after encoding categorical features

Encoding

Categorical features like Sex, Embarked were encoded using LabelEncoder for heatmap analysis

Data Visualization

Countplots, Boxplots, Histograms, and Heatmaps using Seaborn and Matplotlib

ðŸ“¸ Plots
All plots are saved in the plots/ folder:

survival_count.png
